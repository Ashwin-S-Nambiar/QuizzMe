***`QuizzMe!` is a quiz taking platform that uses questions from [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). The website initially presents the user with a selection form, using which the user is able to select the `Category`, `Difficulty`, `Type` and `Number of Questions` accordingly. On clicking the `Start Quiz` button the questions are loaded on the screen.

Once you select the answers for all the questions, then the `Check answers` button will be enabled and on clicking it you will be shown your score and if you have a perfect score then a `Confetti Animation` from `React-Confetti` package will be displayed and the `Check answers` button will change to `Play Again` in order to restart the game.
